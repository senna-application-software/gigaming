Online Backend Test 

i'm using PHP to solve this test

- Firstly, i get the entirely data from the source and then transform it into array associative using json_decode.
- Then i sort it using asort (Associative array sort).

We have data collection in descending order now.
- The next to do is grouping data by age. And show their name
- sort the data by name alphabetically
- next to do is to find array with the same length (maximum amount) and group it into new array
- lastly order the last data by "name and age" alphabeticaly.
